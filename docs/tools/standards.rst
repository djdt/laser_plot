Standards Tool
==============
.. index:: Standards Tool

* **Tools -> Standards Tool**

Opening the `Standards Tool` will load the active laser image,
allowing the generation of a calibration curve from external standards.
For easy of use data should be collected line-by-line with all similar calibration levels in adjacent lines.

The number of calibration levels and regions is selected using the `Levels` box and will reset region positions.
Calibration regions can be moved or resized using the mouse and multiple regions can be moved or resized by first selecting with **Shift** or **Ctrl**.

Clicking `Apply` will apply the calibration to the current image while `Apply to All` will add the calibration *to all open images*.
