.. Region Selection
.. ================

.. Most elemental images have small regions of interest contained within the bulk of the image.
.. The selection tools in |pewpew| allow extraction of information from these regions.
.. Right clicking a selected region will show a context menu allowing:
..     - A `Statistics Dialog` of the selection.
..     - A `Colocalisation Dialog` of the selection.
..     - Copying the selection as a column of text values.
..     - Cropping the image to the selection.

.. Manual Selection
.. ----------------

..     A series of regions selected using the `Lasso Selector` tool.
..     The colour of selection depends on the users system colours.

.. |pewpew| implements two different tools for manual region selection,
.. the `Rectangle Selector` and `Lasso Selector`.
.. These tools function similarly to selection tools in other programs,
.. with regions selected by clicking and dragging on the image.

.. Holding **Shift** will **add** to the currently selected region while holding **Ctrl** will **subtract** from it.
