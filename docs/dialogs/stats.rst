Statistics
==========

* **Image Context Menu -> Statistics**
* **Selection Context Menu -> Statistics**

Basic statistical data is available in the `Statistics` dialog, accessible by right clicking an image.
If a region is selected (see :ref:`Region Selection`) then the dialog will only process
that region, otherwise the entire image is processed.
To copy the statistics for all available elements click the `Copy to Clipboard` button.
